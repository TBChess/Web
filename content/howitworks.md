    <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold  mb-4">Thinking of Joining an Event?</h1>
    <h2 class="text-muted mb-4"> Here's all you need to know</h2>
</div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Do I need to be a good chess player to participate? I'm not that good.</h2>
        <p>You do not. Our events are open to everyone. We have experienced players as well as beginners, and everyone in between.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">I've never played a chess tournament. Is it for me?</h2>
        <p>If you like chess, you'll love our tournament format. You'll get to play chess with different opponents, learn how to use a clock and level up your chess game!</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Does it cost anything?</h2>
        <p>No. All of our events are free to participate. We do encourage people to purchase something from the hosting venue, so if you get thirsty grab a beverage!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">How long do the events take?</h2>
        <p>Usually around 2-3 hours.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Do I have to be right on time?</h2>
        <p>While we recommend people to show up on time, you can still play even if you arrive a bit late. We allow late registrations up until half the number of rounds have been played (but you might miss out on achieving the highest score for 1st place).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Do I have to stay until the end?</h2>
        <p>You can withdraw from a tournament at any time, but you might miss out on some of the fun.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Is it high pressure?</h2>
        <p>Not really, but it depends on the individual. Compared to classical chess tournaments, our events are very casual and laid-back. We play with a clock and there will be some thrilling moments. Try one and decide for yourself!</p>
    </div>   
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Who runs the tournament?</h2>
        <p>Our <a href="https://app.tbchess.org">mobile app</a> assigns the pairs, compute the scores and makes the tournament go fast. If you've never experienced it, you have to try it.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Do I need to bring anything?</h2>
        <p>If you have a chess board, bring it! If not, other players will likely have one. Bring a chess clock if you have one. If not, no worries. Our mobile app provides a clock that works on your phone.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">When should I register?</h2>
        <p>To guarantee a spot, as soon as possible: we have limited spots due to the number of tables available at venues and it's first-come first-serve. You can <a href="https://lu.ma/tbchess">register here</a>.</p>
